# Our Example Application

A README file to go alongside our application. 

If you want to use this to compare to other open source examples, the
generally accepted standard would be that this directory would be the top
level directory with the docker-compose.yaml alongside.

A terraform directory or example would likely be a separate repository in part
because it would more likely contain specific credentials/secrets.
